# gpt-author v2
By Matt Shumer (https://twitter.com/mattshumer_)

Github repo: https://github.com/mshumer/gpt-author

Generate an entire novel in minutes, and automatically package it as an e-book.

To generate a book:
1.  In the first cell, add in your OpenAI, Stability, and (optionally, Anthropic) keys (see the first cell for instructions to get them).
2.  Fill in the prompt, number of chapters, and writing style in the last cell.
3. Run all the cells! After some time, your EPUB file should appear in the filesystem.
